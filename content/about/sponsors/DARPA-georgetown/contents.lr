description:

DARPA's Resilient Anonymous Communication for Everyone (RACE) program researches technologies for a distributed messaging system that can: a) exist completely within a given network, b) provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability of messaging, and c) preserve privacy to any participant in the system. This contract supports our work to develop, integrate and analyze a suite of obfuscated channels to support RACE goals for varying adversarial networks.
