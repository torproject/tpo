description:
The Tor Project encourages developers to use the name Tor in ways that do not confuse the public about the source of anonymity software and services. If you are building open-source non-commercial software or services that incorporate or work with The Tor Project's code, you may use the name “Tor” in an accurate description of your work. We ask you to include a link to the official Tor website https://www.torproject.org/ so users can verify the original source of Tor for themselves, and a note indicating that your project is not sponsored by The Tor Project. For example, “This product is produced independently from the Tor® anonymity software and carries no guarantee from The Tor Project about quality, suitability or anything else.”
