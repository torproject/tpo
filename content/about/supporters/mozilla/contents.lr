description:

Mozilla's mission is to ensure the Internet is a global public resource, open and accessible to all.
Several grants from Mozilla, including the Mozilla Open Source Support (MOSS) awards program, helped with the following projects: maintaining TorBirdy, a plugin to connect your email client Thunderbird with Tor; modularization of Tor network codebase making it more accessible, faster, and easier to adopt; significant improvements to OONI Explorer; Open Web Fellowship; Glass Room exhibit; and Mozilla's year-end matching funds that help all of Tor's important work.
