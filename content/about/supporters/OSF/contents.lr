The Open Society Foundations, founded by George Soros, are the world's
largest private funder of independent groups working for justice,
democratic governance, and human rights. The Open Society Foundations
support Tor's work to a) deliver digital safety and security trainings
to human rights defenders, activists, journalists, former detainees,
and the families of these communities in the MENA diaspora and b)
enable Iranians to access the Tor network during censorship events.
