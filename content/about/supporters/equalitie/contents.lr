description:

eQualitie develops open technologies to promote digital resilience, especially
in environments threatened by censorship, surveillance, climate change, and
network isolation. eQualitie, through its Breakout Program, seeks to support
innovative projects that advance public benefit by promoting secure and
unrestricted communications, particularly in regions with restricted access.
eQualitie is supporting the Conjure Project which aims to strengthen Torâ€™s
ability to function in increasingly restrictive Internet environments by
transitioning Conjure from its current MVP stage to a deployable, real-world
solution.
