  <p>
    PrivChat is a fundraising event series held to raise donations for the Tor Project. Through PrivChat, we will bring you important information related to what is happening in tech, human rights, and internet freedom by convening experts for a chat with our community.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="container">
  <p>
    PrivChat is free to attend. If you get value out of these events and you like Tor, <a href="https://donate.torproject.org/monthly-giving" alt="Tor Project Donate" target="_blank"><mark>please consider becoming a monthly donor</mark></a>. Reliable, predictable support is the best way to ensure Tor remains strong and stable.

    Our goal with PrivChat is to build a two-way support system. You will get access to information from leading minds thinking about and working on privacy, technology, and human rights. And the Tor Project will be more agile in our development as a result of your support, allowing us to respond more rapidly to increasing surveillance and censorship threats (and host more PrivChats)!

      Celebrate 25 years of onion routing with Tor!
    </p>
    <p class="font-family-serif">  
      May 31, 2021 marks the 25th anniversary of the first public presentation of onion routing in Cambridge, UK at Isaac Newton Institute's first Information Hiding Workshop.
    </p>
    <p class="font-family-serif">
      You're invited to celebrate this special moment with us to talk about the beginnings of onion routing, and how this idea became Tor, and how the Tor Project eventually came to be. We’ll be joined by <strong>Paul Syverson</strong>, one of the authors of the <a href="https://www.onion-router.net/Publications.html#IH-1996">first onion routing paper</a>, together with the Tor Project co-founders <strong>Roger Dingledine</strong> and <strong>Nick Mathewson</strong>.
    </p>
    <p class="font-family-serif">
      We'll reflect on the first days of the onion routing network at the U.S. Naval Research Lab (NRL). (Back then, onion router connections went through five nodes instead of Tor's current three-nodes design!) It's no secret that the concept of onion routing originated at NRL (it's on <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/history/">our history page</a>), but there is so much more we want to share about how Tor started and where we've come in the last 25 years.
    </p>
    <p class="font-family-serif">
      <strong>Gabriella Coleman</strong> – anthropologist, author, and Tor board member – will join us as our host and moderator. Join us for a celebratory edition of PrivChat to commemorate the 25th anniversary of onion routing.

            The Tor Project's main mission is to advance human rights and freedoms by creating and deploying free and open source anonymity and privacy technologies. People use our technology, namely the Tor network and Tor Browser, in diverse ways. Tor is used by whistleblowers who need a safe way to bring to light information about wrongdoing -- information that is crucial for society to know -- without sharing their identity. Tor is used by activists around the world who are fighting against authoritarian governments and to defend human rights, not only for their safety and anonymity, but also to circumvent internet censorship so their voices can be heard. Tor allows millions of people to protect themselves online, no matter what privilege they have or don't have. For our third edition of PrivChat, we are bringing you some real-life Tor users who will share how Tor has been important for them and their work to defend human rights and freedoms around the world.

          Every year, internet censorship increases globally. From network level blocking to nation-wide internet blackouts, governments and private companies have powerful tools to restrict information and hault connection between people. Many people, groups, and organizations are doing innovative work to study, measure, and fight back against internet censorship--and they are helping millions of people connect more regularly and safely to the internet. Despite these successes, we're faced with well-funded adversaries that have billions of dollars to spend on censorship mechanisms, and the arms race is ongoing. The second edition of PrivChat with Tor will be about the Good, the Bad and the Ugly that is happening in the front lines of censorship circumvention. In a world where censorship technology is increasingly sophisticated and bought and sold between nations, so is our creativity to measure it and build tools to bypass it, as well as the willingness of people to fight back. But is it enough? What are the barriers facing the people and organizations fighting for internet freedom?

          When the COVID-19 pandemic hit most countries around the world, many governments looked for technology to trace the spread of the virus in order to fight the pandemic. Contact tracing practices and technologies raised many questions about privacy, particularly: is it possible to trace the virus while respecting people's privacy?

          Now amidst the uprising in the U.S. against systemic racism, followed by protests all around the world, the central question about contact tracing, privacy, and surveillance becomes critical. Can the technology used for tracking the virus be used to track protesters? Will it be?

          For our first ever PrivChat, the Tor Project is bringing you three amazing guests to chat with us about privacy in this context.
